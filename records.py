"""Create type-safe dynamic namedtuples by abusing ordered kwargs!

Example usage:

    >>> r_orig = record(foo='ayy', bar='lmao')
    >>> r_same = record(foo='ayy', bar='lmao')

    >>> r_orig
    record(foo='ayy', bar='lmao')
    >>> r_same
    record(foo='ayy', bar='lmao')

    >>> assert r_orig == r_same

Records with the same fields, in the same order, have the same type:

    >>> assert type(r_orig) is type(r_same)

Records are hashable:

    >>> assert r_orig in {r_orig}
    >>> assert r_orig in {r_same}

Records with different values are not equal, but still have the same type:

    >>> r_diff = record(foo='ayy', bar='wat')

    >>> assert r_orig != r_diff and r_same != r_diff
    >>> assert r_diff not in (r_orig, r_same)
    >>> assert type(r_orig) is type(r_diff)

Different field orders result in different, inequivalent types:

    >>> r_forward = record(foo='ayy', bar='lmao')
    >>> r_reverse = record(bar='lmao', foo='ayy')

    >>> assert r_forward.foo == r_reverse.foo and r_forward.bar == r_reverse.bar
    >>> assert r_forward != r_reverse
    >>> assert type(r_reverse) is not type(r_forward)

Their type names indicate this difference:

    >>> print(type(r_forward))
    <class 'records.record['foo', 'bar']'>

    >>> print(type(r_reverse))
    <class 'records.record['bar', 'foo']'>

Instances are cached:

    >>> assert r_orig is r_same

Caching is implemented via weakrefs, so instances are destroyed when no
non-weak references remain:

    >>> id1 = id(record(a=1, b=2))
    >>> id2 = id(record(a=1, b=2))
    >>> assert id1 != id2

    >>> ref = record(a=1, b=2)
    >>> id1 = id(record(a=1, b=2))
    >>> id2 = id(record(a=1, b=2))
    >>> assert id1 == id2

    >>> del ref
    >>> id1 = id(record(a=1, b=2))
    >>> id2 = id(record(a=1, b=2))
    >>> assert id1 != id2

Note, however, that implicit references may persist during the
evaluation of certain expressions:

    >>> assert record(a=1, b=2) is record(a=1, b=2)

Derivative records can be created by calling instances:

    >>> r_derived = r_orig(bar='wat')
    >>> r_derived
    record(foo='ayy', bar='wat')

Derivative records subclass the base record class, not each other:

    >>> for cls in record(a=1)(b=2)(c=3).__class__.__mro__: print(cls)
    <class 'records.record['a', 'b', 'c']'>
    <class 'records.record'>
    <class 'object'>

Caching still applies to new records created this way:

    >>> assert r_orig() is r_orig
    >>> assert r_orig(foo='ayy') is r_orig
    >>> assert r_orig(foo='ayy', bar='lmao') is r_orig
    >>> assert r_orig(bar='lmao') is r_orig

Even when the fields are provided in a different order in the call:

    >>> assert r_orig(bar='lmao', foo='ayy') is r_orig

    (TODO: This does not seem ideal, but I'm not sure what to do instead.)

New fields can also be added this way:

    >>> r_orig(baz='new')
    record(foo='ayy', bar='lmao', baz='new')

Records have no __dict__, but can easily create one:

    >>> vars(r_orig)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute

    >>> dict(r_orig)
    {'foo': 'ayy', 'bar': 'lmao'}
